# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0]

### Security

- **Breaking:** authentication on `POST /fill` now defaults to enabled (`API_AUTH_ENABLED=true`) and fails closed. Set `API_AUTH_ENABLED=false` for trusted/local use.
- Added per-client rate limiting on `POST /fill` (`RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, default 60; `0` disables) → `rate_limited` (429).
- Added denial-of-service guards: page-count cap (`MAX_PDF_PAGES`, default 200) → `pdf_too_many_pages` (413), and a parsing/extraction time budget (`PDF_READ_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, default 20) → `pdf_processing_timeout` (503). Extraction now runs off the event loop.
- PII minimization: provider-backed calls no longer send raw user-data values or a field's current value; only key names and value type names are shared.
- Hardened temporary-file cleanup so uploaded/generated PDFs are removed on every non-success path, including timeouts and cancellations.

### Changed

- Documented the new configuration, error codes, and privacy behavior in `README.md`, `docs/API.md`, and `docs/OPERATIONS.md`.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- `FillReport` returned by `fill_pdf`, reporting written, review-skipped, and empty-skipped fields.
- `POST /fill` now exposes fill outcome via `X-PDF-Fields-Written`, `X-PDF-Fields-Skipped-Review`, and `X-PDF-Fields-Skipped-Empty` response headers, so non-required fields dropped for review are no longer silently lost.
- Checkbox/radio (`/Btn`) state resolution in the writer plus regression tests for truthy/falsy and report behavior.
- `docs/AUDIT.md`: consolidated document-automation architecture audit with a roadmap.

### Fixed

- Checkbox and radio fields are now written using valid PDF state names (e.g. `/Yes`/`/Off`). Boolean-style inputs (`true`/`yes`/`1`/`on`) previously left controls unchecked.

### Changed

- Documented the new response headers and button-fill behavior in `docs/API.md`.

### Added

- FastAPI service wrapper with `GET /health`, `GET /version`, and `POST /fill` endpoints.
- API tests covering health/version checks and PDF fill upload behavior.
- Container runtime files (`Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`) for deployable packaging.
- Additional regression coverage for response parsing, annotation fallback writing, and API page-context handling.
- Maintainer-facing project docs for API usage, architecture, operations, and contribution flow.
- A pull request template for consistent review hygiene.

### Changed

- Updated README and docs index to align with current API-focused scope.
- Updated dependency manifests to include API runtime packages (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-multipart`).
- Added API hardening controls: optional API key auth, upload size limit, and request ID logging.
- Split runtime and development pip dependencies into `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`.
- Improved sample-form generation so the preferred path produces a real fillable form.
- Improved PDF writer fallback handling for annotation-backed forms and tightened temp-file cleanup in the API layer.
- Tightened repository governance with `main`-only CI triggers and a higher coverage floor.
